This code use the concept stack to create an algorithem
that will create a maze from 0.

Using an array placed in a cordinate (x,y), and i will visit
every place of the cordinates, choosing a neighbour of the location
in the cartesian plane and linking it with the previous location.
The neighbour will be randomly choosen, placing it in the top of my stack
A coodinate will only be visited once, because of it i will have to backtrack
until i can find a neighbour that i didnt visited before
the stack is very useful for soving this problem.

This algorithem is complete, so it does not depend on the number of posible cordinates.
