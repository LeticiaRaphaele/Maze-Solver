This code use the concept stack to create an algorithem
that will create a maze from 0.

Using an array placed in a cordinate (x,y), and i will visit
every place of the cordinates, choosing a neighbour of the location
in the cartesian plane and linking it with the previous location.
The neighbour will be randomly choosen, placing it in the top of my stack
A coodinate will only be visited once, because of it i will have to backtrack
until i can find a neighbour that i didnt visited before
the stack is very useful for soving this problem.

This algorithem is complete, so it does not depend on the number of posible cordinates.


For me to do it i need first to stabilish a gride canvas where wvery spot on the grid is a cell. So the program will choose random "walls" to open the path.
The cell must know its row and col, and also know the status of its wall
